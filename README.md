# Eat My Bubbles 🏊‍♀️

A sleek web app designed to track a swimmer's progress toward qualifying for Regional and State swim meets. Built for personal use, with future scalability in mind.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- [`v0-prototype`](./v0-prototype) – First working version of the app  
- Future versions will be added as new folders: `v1`, `v2`, etc.

## 🚀 Goals

- Quickly check if a swimmer has achieved time standards
- Compare best swim times against qualification cutoffs
- View results by event and course (SCY/LCM)

## 📌 Notes

- Only app source files are committed (no `node_modules` or build output)
- Each version is isolated for clarity and version control
